The repository contains an example (.ipynb-file) of a manually controlled implementation of the scoring algorithm described in detail in our paper [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/3/921).
Briefly, the scoring algorithm is suitable for 1-channel (EEG) rodent data (in .smr format in the example).

More documentation, fully automatic version for bulk analysis, and a tutorial video are coming soon!
